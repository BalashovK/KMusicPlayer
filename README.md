Simple audio player for Windows

I associate .mp3 files with KMusicPlayer on my PC 

This is my favorite way of playing music while programming: 
* browse through my music folders until I find something that would work for the task on hand 
** different programming tasks require different music 
* Play it until I am tired of it or I need to work on something different 
* Repeat the procedure
